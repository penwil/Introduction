	<h1> About </h1>
	<h2> Interactive and Graphic Design Student 
		<p>Studying at Millersville, Pennsylvania</p>
	</h2>
	<h3>
			I am a junior/senior at Millersville University but this is my fourth semester here. I have taken a few class that have covered coding along with HTML and CSS so I have a general idea on how to work with it.  Some other courses I have taken with coding include DESn 144.01, DESN 244.50, and DESN 247.  I plan to apply what I learn here in this course and the skills I learn in this course to future practcies with coding. Most people don’t enjoy coding but I’ve learned that once I better understood it, I began to enjoy it. 

		<p>
			Althought I am studying graphic design and digitial work, I have alwasy been drawn to the architecture and interior design. the thought of designing exterior and interior spaces has always been an interest of mine. I enjoy bringing like to a space whether it be interior or exterior. I enjoy working with different ways of styling and trying out different furniture pieces, color palettes, layouts, and styles. persoanlly I am drawn to an aesthetic that is minimal and modern. I persoanlly enjoy sleek and clean lines with the addition of few abstract peices and colors added in.
